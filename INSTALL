INSTALL - scripts
=================

Each directory contains a makefile with at least two targets. 'install' copies
the files themselves, while 'develop' will install a symbolic link to the local
version of the files. The installation directory can be selected by passing a
value to the DEST_DIR variable. The default installation locations and
additional targets available can be found in the makefiles. The instructions
provided below assume the 'install' target, but may also be used for the other
targets.


INSTALLATION
============

1. Go to the directory containing scripts to be installed (e.g. bin):

    cd bin

2. Run

    make install [DEST_DIR=<directory>]

substituting <directory> with the destination directory. If DEST_DIR is not
passed, the files will be installed to a default location; this may require
running the command as superuser.
